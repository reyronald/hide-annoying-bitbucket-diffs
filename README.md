## Who this is for
Any developer working in a shop that for some reason mandates autogenerated
files under source control, is using BitBucket, and is tired of scrolling
through long diffs for autogenerated files that are not relevant to a code
review.

## Usage
Modify the `@resource` declaration above to point to a text/plain resource
with one regular expression per line. (These must be formatted so that they
can be used in `new RegExp()`). The expressions will be matched against filenames
found in the data-filename attributes for the `<section>` tags in BitBucket's
pull request page. (i.e. "path/to/README.md$" and "composer.lock$" would each
occupy one line.

If your URL structure happens to differ for a pull request page, you may
also modify the `@match` declaration as needed.
